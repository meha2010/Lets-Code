## Currency Exchange Rate Forecasting
### Description: Forecasted currency exchange rates using historical forex data. Applied machine learning techniques, including time series models like ARIMA and deep learning models like LSTM. Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and trend analysis to predict future exchange rates. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
### Tools Used: Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, ARIMA, LSTM, Seaborn), Kaggle, NumPy, Plotly
